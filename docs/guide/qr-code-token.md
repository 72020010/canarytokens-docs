# QR Code Token

## What is a QR Code Token

This token works by encoding a URL as a QR code. When the QR code is scanned and the URL is loaded, the token sends an alert.

## Creating the token

Create a token by choosing "QR Code" from the drop down list.

Leave a reasonable comment to remind yourself where you will deploy the token.

The QR image can be downloaded and placed wherever you like.

## Where to tokenize

A few ideas for use include: putting the code on containers in secure locations; on your desk; or underneath your phone battery when crossing international borders.
