# Fast Redirect Token

## What is a Fast Redirect Token

This token is similar to the HTTP token but the token redirects to a custom address once triggered. The difference between the regular HTTP token and the Fast Redirect is that this token does not collect browser nor browser plugin information. For a redirect that does, see the Slow Redirect token in the next section.

## Creating the token

Create a token by choosing "Fast Redirect" from the drop down list.

Leave a reasonable comment to remind yourself where you will deploy the token. Add the redirect URL to which the token will redirect once fired. Then click "Create New Canarytoken" to create the token.
